## Generate PayNow Singapore QR codes in Python
### Summary
What it says on the tin. This is mainly for frameworks/backends which rely on
generation of a PayNow QR code without the use of NodeJS/JavaScript,
such as sending e-mails or generating PDF files.
### Documentation
This library only generates the ASCII code to be embedded in a QR
code image generator. However, there is sample code to generate the QR code 
image using Pillow. See [`tests/test_payload.py`](https://github.com/daffodilistic/pyPayNowSg/blob/d24ca3f7791a51b4b370f0a005946ccb26bca596/tests/test_payload.py)
for an example.
